# dockerized-swift-format
Swift-Format on a Docker container (From [@palleas][palleas] [article][article])

## Description

I quickly put together Romain's article into a `Docker` image (for now; I'll probably pull it down if he publishes his own version).

## Use

You can pull the image from terminal running the following command:
```console
docker pull esttorhe/swift-format
```

Then you can just use the image as any other `Docker` image.

## Disclaimer

This is not my idea and by all means the whole heavy lifting was done by Romain; I just thought it was a great idea and decided to put it together; most likely this will be a short-lived repository.
